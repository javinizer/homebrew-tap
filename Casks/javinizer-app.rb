# Homebrew Cask template for the Javinizer desktop app (macOS).
#
# Rendered by scripts/homebrew/render-formula.sh from a release's checksums.txt,
# then committed to javinizer/homebrew-tap as Casks/javinizer-app.rb by the
# update-homebrew-tap job in .github/workflows/cli-release.yml.
#
# This is a Cask (not a Formula) because it ships a GUI .app bundle that belongs
# in /Applications, which is the idiomatic Homebrew vehicle for GUI apps. It is
# separate from Formula/javinizer.rb (the CLI) so both can coexist:
#   brew install javinizer          # CLI
#   brew install --cask javinizer-app   # clickable macOS app
#
# Casks are macOS-only (there is no on_linux block), so the Linux AppImage is
# distributed as a direct download from the Releases page instead — AppImages
# are self-contained and need no package manager.
#
# The release asset is a zip built with `ditto -c -k --keepParent`, so unzipping
# yields Javinizer.app/ at the top level, which `app "Javinizer.app"` installs.

  caveats <<~EOS
    The Javinizer app is unsigned. On first launch macOS Gatekeeper may show:
      "Javinizer" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
    Right-click the app → Open → confirm (one-time), or strip the quarantine
    attribute:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Javinizer.app
    See: https://github.com/javinizer/javinizer-go/blob/main/docs/17-desktop-app.md
